      <description>My name is Hayley Briar and I am nearing the very end of my program to obtain my Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Elementary Education and Mild to Moderate Special Education from Grand Canyon University. Special Education has been a passion of mine since I graduated high school and immediately landed an instructional assistant position in a moderate to severe Autism program. I knew I had found my calling in this life and continued working in various programs in age groups from elementary up to an adult transition program until this school year.</description>

      <description>Reflecting on my own growth and time spent working in various educational settings for the last decade, I have been able to build the foundation necessary to become a thoughtful, attentive, and meaningful educator. Working with students and their families is not only an important profession for me, it is my passion in this life. I understand the responsibility I have to the students I work with in providing them the best education possible which means that I myself must always continue to learn and grow in my field.</description>
