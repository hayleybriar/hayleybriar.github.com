Reflecting on my own growth and time spent working in various educational settings for the last decade, I have been able to build the foundation necessary to become a thoughtful, attentive, and meaningful educator. Working with students and their families is not only an important profession for me, it is my passion in this life. I understand the responsibility I have to the students I work with in providing them the best education possible which means that I myself must always continue to learn and grow in my field. This means continuing my own education with specialized trainings and resources, collaborating with colleagues and stakeholders to provide consistent and quality education to students, and reflecting on my own work within the classroom and the community I serve.

By presenting myself with values of respect and compassion, strong ethics in my work and professionalism, communication skills, and a positive attitude I am aligning myself and my performance of work with the “Professional Dispositions” and Model Code of Ethics. I am building my foundation and reputation as a professional, credible, and knowledgeable educator and understand that this takes time. I know I am capable of growth because of my own time spent going through Grand Canyon University and the struggle I dealt with when beginning in this program. My grades from the beginning of the program up until present day are a direct example of taking responsibility for your own actions and well-being, and how that discipline will make you understand, appreciate, and approach the struggles that our students have when learning with compassion.

When completing the self-assessment, it reminded me how many pieces there are to becoming a strong educator and how there is always room for improvement. As most of my experience in education has been in special education programs, I know I need more practice and a different level of patience when working in a general education classroom. I will remain open to adjusting my own skills and training to suit the individual needs of the students I work with. An area of growth for me is creating a positive work environment that fosters success for students as I do not have much practice in this. I can do this by visiting other classrooms and collaborating with other teachers to build an understanding of what works in the classroom and why. Learning from the educators who surround me will be my greatest tool as I advance in my own career.
