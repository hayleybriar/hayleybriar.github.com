My name is Hayley Briar and I am nearing the very end of my program to obtain my Bachelor’s Degree in Elementary Education and Mild to Moderate Special Education from Grand Canyon University. Special Education has been a passion of mine since I graduated high school and immediately landed an instructional assistant position in a moderate to severe Autism program. I knew I had found my calling in this life and continued working in various programs in age groups from elementary up to an adult transition program until this school year. I am currently finishing up my first student teaching session in a General Education 2nd grade classroom where I have learned and experienced so much being in the “teacher’s shoes”. To finish up my student teaching experience, I will be moving onto a Resource Specialist Program math class at the Junior High level and I cannot wait to get started.

I am 29 years old living in a beautiful home in Clovis, California with my two fur babies Nisi (cat) and Odo (dog/velociraptor). I come from a great family that I love to spend as much time as possible with. I enjoy going on road trips all over California seeking the next adventure and in the summer, I frequently visit the lakes in the area to wakeboard, wake surf, and enjoy the sun and my friends. In the wintertime, I am fortunate to live close enough to a ski resort and try to go snowboarding as much as possible.

I have a true passion for working with all types of learners. Helping each student progress in all areas of their development—academic, social, language, motor, behavioral—is a challenge that I am honored to accept daily. I strive to create a community of learners that nurtures this growth in a positive, community-feel environment.
