      <description>Reflecting on my own growth and time spent working in various educational settings for the last decade, I have been able to build the foundation necessary to become a thoughtful, attentive, and meaningful educator. Working with students and their families is not only an important profession for me, it is my passion in this life. I understand the responsibility I have to the students I work with in providing them the best education possible which means that I myself must always continue to learn and grow in my field.</description>
